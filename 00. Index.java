What is Java?
- Java is an object oriented programming language. Java complies source code into the bytecode(.class file) and then its interpreted into machine readable code.

Is Java Platform Independent?
- Yes, Java is a Platform Independent language. This .class file is independent of the software or hardware but needs a JVM preinstalled in the operating system for execution. Although JVM is platform dependent the bytecode can be created on any System and can be executed in any other system which makes Java platform independent.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
- JRE is an installation package that creates an environment to run the Java program or application on any machine.  

JDK (Java Development Kit)
- JDK creates the environment for developing Java applications.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- JVM is part of JRE, JVM is a interpreter converts bytecode(.class file) into machine readable code.

JRE vs JDK
- JDK creates an environment to develop Java programs and JRE to execute Java programs.

What is variables?
- Variables are containers for storing data values.

What is typecasting?
- Typecasting is the process of converting a variable from one type to another. In Java there are two types of casting:
  1. Implicit: automatic type conversion from a smaller to a larger type. Ex - int to double
  2. Explicit: manual type conversion converts a larger type to a smaller type. Ex- double to int

Array
- An array is a container that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
  int[] myIntArray = new int[10];
  String[] myStringArray = new String[50];

What are literals?
-   

What is a function or method?
- A method is a block of code that performs a specific task and can optionally return a result.

What is recursion?
- Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself.

What is constructor?
- A constructor is a block of code similar to a method but unlike methods constructors have no return type and have the same name as the class itself.  

Method overloading
- Method overloading is a process that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name

What is package
